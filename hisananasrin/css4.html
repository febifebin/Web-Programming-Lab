<h2>Internal CSS Example</h2>

<p>The default text color for the page is black. However I can change the color of every paragraph element on the page using internal CSS.</p>

<p>Using internal CSS, I only need to write one rule set to change the color of every paragraph elemnet.</p>

<p>With inline CSS, I'd have to add a style attribute to every single paragraph in my HTML.</p>
